## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes sleep patterns and lifestyle factors using an Excel-based dataset to understand how daily habits influence sleep quality, stress levels, BMI, and overall health.

The goal of this project is to transform raw health data into clear, actionable insights** using data cleaning, pivot tables, and an interactive Excel dashboard.

##  Dashboard Description

The dashboard provides a visual summary of key insights related to sleep health:

### Sleep Duration by Occupation
- Displays the average sleep duration across different occupations
- Helps identify professions associated with shorter or healthier sleep patterns

### Average Stress Level by Occupation
- Compares stress levels across professions
- Highlights occupations with higher stress impact on sleep health

### BMI Category by Sleep Duration
- Shows how sleep duration varies across BMI categories
- Helps explore the relationship between sleep habits and body weight

### Sleep Disorder Distribution
- Visualizes the proportion of individuals with sleep disorders (e.g., insomnia)** versus no disorders
- Provides insight into the prevalence of sleep-related health issues

### Interactive Filters (Slicers)
- Gender  
- Occupation  
- Age Group  

These slicers allow users to interactively explore the data, making the dashboard dynamic and user-friendly.

## Data Preparation & Methodology

Before creating the dashboard, the dataset was cleaned and transformed to ensure data quality:

- Removed duplicate and inconsistent records  
- Handled missing values in sleep, stress, and activity columns  
- Standardized categorical fields (occupation, BMI category, sleep disorder)  
- Created calculated fields for aggregation  
- Structured data for efficient pivot table analysis  

This ensured that all insights shown in the dashboard are accurate and reliable.

## How to Use the Dashboard

1. Download and open the Excel file  
   `Sleep_health_and_lifestyle_data.xlsx`
2. Navigate to the Dashboard sheet  
3. Use slicers to filter data by:
   - Gender  
   - Occupation  
   - Age Group  
4. Observe how charts update dynamically  
5. Analyze trends in sleep duration, stress levels, BMI, and sleep disorders
